            Exciteus Terms of Service

Effective: 16 April 2018 <br><br>

We've drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the "Terms") so you'll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There's a good reason for that: these Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Exciteus. So please read them carefully.

1. Who can use the Services

Everyone is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully.

By using the Services, you state that:

you can form a binding contract with Exciteus.

you will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.

If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorised to grant all licences set out in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity.

2. Rights we grant you

Exciteus grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable licence to access and use the Services.

Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device's settings.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services. Nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.

3. Rights you grant us

Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a licence to use that content. How broad that licence is depends on which Services you use and the settings you have selected.

We call Story submissions that are set to be viewable by Everyone as well as content you submit to crowd-sourced Services, including Our Story, "Public Content." For all content you submit to the Services other than Public Content, you grant Exciteus and their affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable licence to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content for as long as you use the Services. This licence is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.

Because Public Content is public by nature and records matters of public interest, the licence you grant us for this content is broader. In addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph, you also grant us a licence to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicence, publicly perform and publicly display Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).

The Services may contain advertisements. In consideration Exciteus letting you access and use the Services, you agree that we Exciteus and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services, including personalised advertising based upon the information you provide us or we collect or obtain about you. Because the Services contain content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes appear near, between, over, or in your content.

We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you.

4. Respecting other people's rights

Exciteus respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services, or enable anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that:

路       violates or infringes someone else's rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual-property right;

路       bullies, harasses, or intimidates;

路       defames;

路       spams or solicits our users.

You must also respect the rights of Exciteus. These Terms do not grant you any right to do any of the following (or enable anyone else do so):

use branding, logos, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in our Services;

copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as authorised in these Terms;

use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes without our consent.

5. Respecting copyright

We respect copyright law. We therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if Exciteus becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user's account.

6. Safety

We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can't guarantee it. That's where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that:

You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.

You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract other users' information.

You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users' content or information without our written consent.

You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, affect negatively, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services.

You will not use or attempt to use another user's account, username, or password without their permission.

You will not solicit login credentials from another user.

You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or incitements to violence.

You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.

You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorised to access.

You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.

You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.

We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never use Exciteus and drive. And never put yourself or others in harm's way just to capture a picture or video.

7. Data charges and mobile phones

You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you're unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.

8. Third-party services

If you use a service, feature or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we offer jointly with the third party), each party's terms will govern the respective party's relationship with you. Exciteus is not responsible or liable for a third party's terms or actions taken under the third party's terms.

9. Modifying the Services and termination

We're relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. This means that we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we will try to notify you beforehand - but this won't always be possible.

10. Disclaimers

We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we cannot promise that we will always succeed.

The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" and to the extent permitted by law without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, in particular implied warranties, conditions, or other terms relating to (i) merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, non-infringement, or (ii) arising from a course of dealing. In addition, while Exciteus attempts to provide a good user experience, we do not represent or warrant that: (a) the Services will always be secure, error-free or timely; (b) the Services will always function without delays, disruption or imperfections; or (c) that any content or information you obtain through the Services will be timely or accurate.

11. Dispute resolution, arbitration

If you have a concern, let's talk. Go ahead and contact us first and we'll do our best to resolve the issue.

12. Exclusive venue

To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Exciteus agree that all claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of England in the United Kingdom, unless this is prohibited by the laws of the country where you reside. You and Exciteus consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.

13. Additional terms for specific Services

Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be presented to you before you access the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us when you accept them. If any part of those additional terms and conditions conflicts with these Terms, the additional terms and conditions will prevail.

14. Final terms

These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and Exciteus and supersede any prior agreements.

These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.

If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.
